# Abstract Factory

## Scenario

Imagine you are designing a software application for a furniture store. The application needs to handle the creation of different types of furniture, such as chairs, tables and sofas. Each of these types of furniture can have different styles, such as modern, classic and rustic.

## Problem

If you directly create objects of these furniture types, you would have to write a lot of code to handle the variations in styles. This would make the code more complex and difficult to maintain.

## Solution

The Abstract Factory pattern can be used to solve this problem by creating an abstract class for each type of furniture. This abstract class would define the interfaces for creating furniture objects of differennt styles. Then, concrete classes can be created for each style to implement these interfaces.

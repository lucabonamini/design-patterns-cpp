# Builder

## Scenario

Imagine you are developing software for a computer manufacturing company that offers customizable computers. Each computer can vary in terms of its central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), storage capacity, and graphics card. The challenge is to create a flexible system that allows customers to configure and order computers with different specifications.

## Problem

Directly instantiating objects of the **Computer** class with various configurations would result in a complex and inflexible system. Furthermore, handling the numerous combinations of components in a single constructor could lead to readability and maintainability issues.

## Solution

The Builder pattern provides an elegant solution to this problem by introducing an abstraction layer between the client code and the actual construction of the Computer objects. This pattern involves an abstract builder interface (**ComputerBuilder**) with methods for building different parts of the computer. Concrete builder classes (e.g., **GamingComputerBuilder**) implement this interface to construct specific types of computers.

# Prototype

## Scenario

Imagine you are developing software for a printing company that specializes in personalized business cards. Each business card consists of contact information and an address, and customers often request variations of their business cards. The challenge is to efficiently create customized business cards without recreating the entire structure for each variation.

## Problem

Directly creating and customizing business cards through traditional instantiation and modification can lead to code duplication and complexity. Moreover, if customers request multiple variations, managing these variations becomes challenging.

## Solution

The Prototype pattern provides an elegant solution to this problem by introducing a prototype (BusinessCard) that serves as a blueprint for creating personalized business cards. The prototype is cloned to create new instances, and variations are applied to the clones. This way, the structure remains intact, and customization is achieved without reconstructing the entire object.
